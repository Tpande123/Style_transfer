# Introduction: -

Transfering the style of an image using a vgg19 model i.e. the style image onto another image i.e. the content image to form a target image. The content image used here is a photo of a mountain range and the style image is a painting of the famous artist Robert Dalaunay.


## Prerequirements for both the code files: -

1.) Jupyter Notebook or google collab.

2.) Importing a pretrained vgg19 model to perform the style transfer.

3.) Importing the style image delaunay.jpeg and the content image mountain.jpeg


## How to run the code: - 

1.) Open the jupyter notebook terminal(or upload and open in google collab) 

2.) Navigate to the folder where the zip file is extracted to and open the respective .ipynb file provided in their respective folder. The code and the output to that code will be visible.

3.) To rerun the whole notebook again, press kernel and press Restart and run all. (For jupyter notebook users)
